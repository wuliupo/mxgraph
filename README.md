mxgraph
=======

The mxGraph package contains a client software, written in `JavaScript`, and a series of backends for various languages (`Java`, `.net`, `PHP`). The client software is a graph component with an optional application wrapper that is integrated into an existing web interface. The client requires a webserver to deliver the required files to the client or can be run from the local filesystem without a webserver. The backends may be used as is, or they may be embedded into an existing server application in one of the supported languages.
